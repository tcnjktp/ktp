            </header>
            <p>
             Greetings, 
            </p>
             I am Jeffrey Ernest, the current President of Kappa Theta Pi (KTP), and I am pleased to extend a warm welcome to you. As we navigate through this semester, I am eager to share the exciting developments taking place within and around KTP.
            <p>
              As a second-semester Sophomore at TCNJ, pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Interactive Multimedia, I am honored to represent Kappa Theta Pi—the nation's first Co-Ed Professional Technology Fraternity. The Zeta Chapter, established in 2019 with the support of our founding members, originated from the University of Michigan. Our fraternity is home to some of the most talented minds on campus, brought together by a shared passion for technology. We invite you to join our dedicated and accomplished community here at TCNJ.
            </p>
              Kappa Theta Pi is distinctive in its inclusivity. Unlike other professional fraternities on campus, we welcome individuals from all majors, valuing the diverse perspectives and strengths that contribute to our brotherhood. KTP stands out as a unique space where students with varying backgrounds and levels of tech expertise converge to forge lasting friendships. Unlike major-specific organizations, we unite individuals with a shared curiosity and passion for technology, spanning software, hardware, physical tech, and beyond.
            <p>
              As we approach our eighth rush season in Spring 2024, we eagerly anticipate welcoming new perspectives into our fraternity. Beyond the enjoyable brotherhood events, KTP is a professional fraternity committed to preparing its members for the professional world, offering guidance on resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and connections with our esteemed alumni in notable companies.
            </p>
              Kappa Theta Pi provides an inclusive and encouraging environment to enhance your college experience. We adhere to a "work hard, play hard" philosophy, emphasizing the importance of being a well-rounded student. Through various professional development, social engagements, and community service events, our fraternity ensures that members experience the best aspects of college life while contributing meaningfully to society.
            <p>
              In my capacity as President, I am enthusiastic about leading the chapter this semester. Working closely with the E-board, our goal is to curate top-notch events and opportunities for our members. I wholeheartedly encourage anyone with an interest in technology or a desire to form professional connections to consider rushing for Kappa Theta Pi. Join us, not just to meet friends, but to create lasting memories and cultivate valuable skills for your future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Best regards,<br>Jeffrey Ernest
              <p>

              Kappa Theta Pi takes pride in being the first professional technology fraternity in the country. Our members learn a plethora of skills needed to stay knowledgeable about the tech industry, as well as a strong sense of professional development for future job positions. </p>
            </p>
            <p>
              KTP was founded on January 10, 2012, at the University of Michigan with the mission to create a tech community that enthusiastic students could join. In making KTP, the founders set up a strong community that has only grown in the 8 years since its inception.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our members come from all around campus. We are designers, analysts, computer scientists, engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, economists, philosophers, psychologists, and more. What makes the KTP community strong is our shared passion for technology and our unique backgrounds meshing together as one.
            </p>
            <p>
              KTP alumni are part of an extensive and tight-knit network that stretches across the country. They can be found from Seattle to New York, from Silicon Valley to Detroit, in both startup companies and larger businesses. Our alumni provide valuable insight for our members’ professional development.

            <p>
              I barely knew how to code when I rushed KTP, and I didn’t believe that I would ever truly feel like a “techie”. I expected an intimidating code-bro environment, but instead I found warmth, and support from a diverse and accomplished group. After three and a half years, I can easily say that I owe my job, my best friends, and so much more to KTP.

            <p>
              KTP was like another family to me during my time at Michigan. I have never been part of a community of individuals who shared similar interests as me. It allowed me to meet such wonderful people that I still talk to even in post grad life! No matter where in the country I travel, there is always someone from KTP to meet up with and just catch up!

              Above all else, KTP brought me people. It brought me people to commiserate through courses with. People to push, challenge, inspire me. People to learn, change, grow with. People to love & be loved by. The people & the ways we grew together stayed with me even now, long after graduation.
